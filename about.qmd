# Hello, I'm Xiaohan Zhang! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring data analytics professional currently pursuing my Master of IT in Business (Analytics Track) at Singapore Management University. With a background in Management from Beijing Normal University, I bridge the gap between business insights and technical solutions.

## My Journey

My analytics journey started during my undergraduate years, where I discovered my passion for using data to solve real-world problems. This led me to participate in the Mathematical Contest in Modeling, where my team and I developed a predictive model for drought-resistant agriculture, earning recognition as Meritorious Winners (top 7% globally).

## What I Do

I'm developing my skills in: - Data Analysis and Visualization - Predictive Modeling - Machine Learning Applications - Business Intelligence - Query Optimization

## Recent Projects

I've worked on diverse projects that demonstrate my analytical capabilities:

-   Conducted comprehensive analysis of Singapore's HDB resale market, studying price trends during and after COVID-19
-   Developed market segmentation strategies for an international retailer in the Philippines
-   Created an innovative Obesity Risk Prediction model for South American health data
-   Optimized database query performance, achieving 50% faster execution times

## Technical Expertise

I'm continuously learning and developing my skills in: - Programming: Python, R, MATLAB - Database: MySQL, SQL - Analytics Tools: SAS Viya, SPSS, Tableau - Business Tools: Excel (Advanced)

## Beyond the Numbers

I believe in using technology for social good. I've volunteered at schools for special needs children, and as a debate team leader, I've coordinated events involving multiple colleges and over 100 participants. This experience has taught me the importance of clear communication and leadership in bringing people together.

## Looking Forward

I'm currently seeking opportunities to apply my analytical skills in real-world business scenarios. With work authorization in both Singapore (for internships) and China, I'm ready to take on new challenges and contribute to innovative projects.
